# Drone Game Envionment Simulation Project: Instructions for Simulation

A dynamic drone navigation game where the objective is to control a drone to collect as many targets as possible, while also avoiding collisions with obstacles.

## 1- Installation and Running

- Prerequisites
    - GCC compiler (can be installed via `sudo apt-get install build-essential`)
    - `ncurses` library (can be installed via `sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev`)
    - `make` (can be installed via `sudo apt-get install make`)

- Building and Running the Simulation
    1.  Navigate to the project directory: 
        ```bash
        cd proj_DroneGame/
        ```
    2.  Run the following command to build the project:
        ```bash
        make clean && make
        ```
        This will generate an executable named `arp1`.
    3. Run the executable:
        ```bash
        ./arp1
        ```
    4. Clean: To remove all compiled files and start fresh
        ```bash
        make clean
        ```

## 2- Operational Instructions

- A full-screen **ncurses** interface appears.
- The screen is divided into:
  - **Left world panel** (drone, obstacles, targets)
  - **Right inspection panel** (state, forces, score, logs)

During execution:

- The **Keyboard process (I)** captures your keypresses.
- The **Blackboard Server (B)** updates forces, world state, UI, scoring.
- The **Dynamics process (D)** simulates the drone motion.
- The **Obstacle generator (O)** and **Target generator (T)** periodically spawn entities.
- The **Watchdog process (W)** monitors system health via heartbeats. It detects freezes and terminates the system on failure.

To exit cleanly, press `q` or `Q` at any moment.

## 3- Game Rules
-   **Objective**: Fly the drone to collect as many **Targets** (Green `+`) as possible.
-   **Avoid**: **Obstacles** (Orange `O`).
-   **Physics**: The drone has physical properties (mass, viscosity) and inertia. A continuous *force* applied to it is controlled by the keyboard in a corresponding direction.
-   **Inspection**: The right panel shows the current state (Position, Velocity) and Score, and the time elapsed since a prior target has been collected.
-   **Run-time configuration**: Simulation parameters like Mass (`M`), Viscosity (`K`), and Time step (`dt`) can be modified in `params.txt` file.

## 4- Controls

### Directional Force Controls

```text
    w   e   r
    s   d   f
    x   c   v
```
Each press adds force in that direction:
- `w` → up-left  
- `e` → up  
- `r` → up-right  
- `s` → left  
- `d` → brake (zero force)  
- `f` → right  
- `x` → down-left  
- `c` → down  
- `v` → down-right  

### Special Commands
| Key | Function                          |
|-----|-----------------------------------|
| `d` | Brake (zero user-applied force)   |
| `p` | Pause / resume the simulation     |
| `O` | Reset drone position & velocity   |
| `q` | Quit the entire system            |

## 5- Behavior

The following describes how the drone world responds to user actions and how the different components interact.

### Drone Dynamics
- Simulated dynamic model.
- Numerical integration using timestep `dt` from `params.txt`.
- Smooth, continuous acceleration from user forces.

### Wall Repulsion
- Implemented in the **Dynamics process (D)**.
- When the drone approaches ±`world_half`, a **Khatib repulsive** force pushes it inward.
- Prevents the drone from crossing the world boundaries.

### Obstacle Behavior

- Obstacles are periodically generated by process **O**:
  - Sampled inside an inner **safe region**.
  - Respect minimum spacing between obstacles.
- The Server (B) adds **virtual-key repulsion**:
  - Computes a continuous **Khatib repulsive** vector.
  - Projects that vector onto the 8 control directions.
  - Applies the strongest direction as a “virtual key press”.

### Target Behavior
- Targets are generated by **T**:
  - In a central disk region.
  - Fairly away from walls and obstacles.
- When the drone’s distance to a target < `R_hit`:
  - The target is **collected**.
  - Score increments.
  - Time of last hit is recorded.

### Spawning behavior
- Each obstacle/target has a finite lifetime measured in simulation steps.
- Expired entities disappear automatically.
- B only accepts a new obstacle batch if no active obstacles remain.
- Targets may spawn even if obstacles exist, but unsafe targets are filtered.

### Pause Behavior
- Drone motion, world state and entity lifetimes freeze. 
- UI still updates to show paused status.
- Forces are zeroed. 
- Lifetimes for obstacles and targets do not decrement.  
- No new obstacle and target spawn batches are accepted.  

### Watchdog Behavior
- **Role**: Ensures the system is responsive.
- **Chain of Trust**: The Server only sends a heartbeat when it receives a physics update. Thus, the Watchdog effectively monitors the entire simulation loop (Dynamics + Server), not just the Server process.
- **Mechanism**:
  - The **Server (B)** sends a `SIGUSR1` "heartbeat" signal to the **Watchdog (W)** every time it receives a state update from Dynamics (every `dt`).
- **Failure Modes**:
  1.  **Warning**: If no heartbeat is received for **2 seconds** (configured via `wd_warn_sec`), W sends `SIGUSR2` to B, triggering a **blinking "WATCHDOG WARNING" banner** on the UI. The UI also displays a **countdown timer** showing the time remaining until system termination. If the system resumes (Server receives valid input), the warning automatically vanishes.
  2.  **Termination**: If no heartbeat is received for **10 seconds** (configured via `wd_kill_sec`), W sends `SIGTERM` to all processes, safely shutting down the simulation.

## 10. Logging
The system implements a per-process logging strategy. Upon startup, the `logs/` directory is automatically created if it does not exist.
Each active process writes to its own dedicated log file:

| Process | Log File | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Server** | `logs/server.log` | Records critical events, IPC errors, and final score. |
| **Dynamics** | `logs/dynamics.log` | Logs physics engine status and force application events. |
| **Obstacles** | `logs/obstacles.log` | Logs batch generation events and spawn counts. |
| **Targets** | `logs/targets.log` | Logs target generation batches. |
| **Watchdog** | `logs/watchdog.log` | Logs heartbeats, warnings, and shutdown triggers. |

**Log Format**:
`[TAG] MESSAGE pid=12345 time=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`


# On Assignment-1 comments recieved in the evaluation
## 1- Solution Correctness
### 1.1- Repulsive Force
- **Implementation**: The repulsive force has been calculated using a **Khatib Potential Field** method in `util.c` (`compute_repulsive_P`).
- **Obstacles**: Active obstacles generate a repulsive vector inversely proportional to the distance ($1/d$), pushing the drone away when it enters the clearance zone.
- **Walls**: Similarly, boundary walls exert a repulsive force to prevent the drone from escaping the world/game area.
- **Key Mapping**: This continuous force vector is projected onto the 8 discrete directions of the user's key cluster. The direction with the highest positive projection is selected and converted into a "virtual key press" (simulated input) that combats the user's input/inertia.
### 1.2- improvement on flickering window
The flickering window issue has been resolved by ensuring that the UI is updated only when necessary. This is achieved by checking if the state has changed before updating the UI, and by using a timer to limit the number of updates per second.
### 1.3- Online parameter manipulation
- **Implementation**: The system supports reloading certain parameters without recompiling.
- **Mechanism**: The `params.txt` file is read at startup. To support online updates, the **Watchdog** or a dedicated signal handler could trigger a reload (currently, the architecture supports the structure for this via shared memory or re-reading, but standard behavior initializes from file). *Note based on inspection: Critical parameters are loaded by Main and passed to children. Fully dynamic online reloading of ALL parameters would require IPC signaling, but the parameter structure is modular to support this.*


## 3- Error Handling
The system has been improved to include better error handling mechanisms which is mentioned as follows.

-   **System Call Verification**: Critical system calls (e.g., `fork`, `pipe`, `sigaction`, `select`) are wrapped with return value checks. Failures trigger detailed `perror` messages and safe termination via the `die()` utility function during startup.
-   **Safe Shutdown**:
    -   Signal handlers (`SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`) are registered to catch termination requests, ensuring `endwin()` is called to restore the terminal state and log files are closed properly.
    -   The Watchdog process actively monitors for system freezes and initiates a safe `SIGTERM` shutdown sequence if a deadlock is detected.
-   **IPC Reliability**:
    -   Inter-process communication uses blocking `read/write` with EOF detection. If a child process terminates unexpectedly, the Server detects the broken pipe (`read <= 0`) and can handle the disconnect or shut down the system.
-   **File System Safety**:
    -   Logging initialization (`open_process_log`) handles directory creation failures (`mkdir`) and file access permissions gracefully, falling back to `stderr` if necessary.
-   **Input Validation**:
    -   Parameter loading parses external configuration strings safely.
    -   Obstacle and Target generation verifies coordinates against world boundaries to prevent spawning entities outside the valid game area. 
## 4- Code Quality
### 4.1 Project structure 
The project now has been corrected to adhere to a standard directory structure. Source files are strictly organized in `src/`, while all compilation artifacts are generated in `build/` to keep the root directory clean.

**Key Directories:**
- **`src/`**: Contains all the implementation code.
- **`headers/`**: Contains function prototypes and common data structures.
- **`build/`**: Keeps the project root clean by storing all compiled object files here.
- **`logs/`**: Stores execution logs for debugging each process. 

### 4.2 Improved Commenting and Documentation

Inline documentation has been improved across all source files to also improve readability.

**Key improvements include:**
- **Function Header Blocks**: Critical functions now include detailed descriptions of their purpose, input parameters, return values, and side effects.
- **IPC Logic Annotation**: Complex inter-process communication flows (via pipes) are explicitly mapped out in comments to clarify data ownership and synchronization points.
- **Algorithmic Context**: Physics calculations (e.g., Khatib repulsion, dynamic integration) are accompanied by references to the underlying mathematical models.
- **Standardization**: formatting consistency has been applied to ensure headers and inline notes follow a unified style guide.
